# Life Goals Tree 🌳

**Life Goals Tree** is a self-hosted, interactive application designed to help you visualise and map out your life's journey. Built as a single-file Python application using Flask, D3.js, and Three.js, it offers two distinct views: a 2D force-directed graph for managing goal dependencies and relationships, and an immersive 3D timeline to view your milestones chronologically. All data is stored locally in a JSON file.

To get started, simply ensure you have Python installed, install the dependency via `pip install flask`, and execute the script with `python life_tree.py`. The application will launch in your web browser.
